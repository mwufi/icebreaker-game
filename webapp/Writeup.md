# Welcome, ODF26

Yesterday was great. We got introduced, learned a lot about each other, and also talked with each other after the main event. We hung out on morning runs, bike rides, in restaurants and bars, talking about everything from weather to where we're going.

We came away with new friends, thought partners, funny moments and more.

And yet what's magical about having a group this size is how much we have *yet* to cover. The synergies, what-if's, and alternate timelines. What if you had met someone different, or if your small group had another person? What if you had shared about that one part of your life, that would totally have made sense to somebody else?

## Our experiment
SuperSecret is a layer on top of ODF for connecting with each other in a new, interesting way.

We’re not building a social platform. We’re building a pro-social device — a small experiment in seeing what happens when we give friendship, serendipity, and curiosity just a little more room to grow.

Technology doesn’t just change what we do; it changes who we are. Our mission — should you choose to accept it — is simple: 

stay connected, explore deeper, and help shape what it means to meet each other at our best.

This is definitely a WIP. It won't do everything. Heck, it can't even do 1 thing. We don’t know exactly what it will become - but we think there's a space for play.

So press play ;)
